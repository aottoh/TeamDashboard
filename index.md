## **(1) Introduction**
This simple web applications serves to display information about team portfolio projects. The data does not automatically update or, nor does it pull any external data. The *'Dashboard'* is dependent on a manually updated excel-file (csv) which is in turn converted into a readable javascript file, which holds the project data in form of 'project objects'.
The aim of this *'Dashboard'* is to provide the user with an easier overview of all the team's related project information. The idea is that all data, links and other relevant team information can be easily accessed through this single platform.

## Naming Convention

HTML / CSS

Classes:
Always start with their html tag type followed by a hyphen and the respective names. If the name consists of more than one word, the name's words can be separated by an underscore.
Example:
For a "<div>" element name "general Information".
div-general_information

IDs:
IDs can be recognized, as they don't have to start with their respective element tag. their name, too, is separated using an underscore. In case an ID does start with its html tag's name, the words will still be separated by an underscore.
Example for a "<div>" element named "general Information".
general_information
div_general_information


JavaScript:

Example: ...
